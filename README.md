# Analyzing-Road-Accident-Data-Project

Domain:- Road Safety and Transportation

Tools & Technologies:- Python(Jupiter Notebook), Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Power BI

Overview of the Project:- 

Road accidents are a major public safety concern, causing significant loss of life and economic damage. Analyzing accident data helps identify key factors influencing accident severity, enabling policymakers and traffic authorities to implement effective safety measures. This project explores a real-world road accident dataset using Python, MS SQL Server and Microsoft PowerBI to uncover patterns, trends, and risk factors. The analysis aims to help policymakers and traffic authorities implement effective safety measures.

Key Features of this Project:-

1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning – Handling missing values, outliers, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding accident patterns through summary statistics and visualizations.
3. Time-Based Analysis – Identifying accident trends across different time periods (daily, monthly, yearly).
4. Road & Environmental Impact – Analyzing how road types, weather conditions, and lighting affect accident severity.
5. Geospatial Analysis – Mapping accident hotspots and identifying high-risk locations using visualization techniques.
6. Accident Severity Analysis – Studying factors that contribute to severe accidents and potential mitigation strategies.
7. Data Visualization – Using charts, graphs, and heatmaps to present findings in an intuitive way.

Conclusion of the project:- 

This Road Accident Data Analysis project provided valuable insights into the factors influencing road accidents, their severity, and accident-prone locations. By analyzing trends, environmental conditions, and road types, the study highlights key risk factors that contribute to accidents.

Key Findings:-

1. Time-Based Trends: Accidents peak during specific hours of the day and seasons, indicating high-risk periods.
2. Road & Weather Conditions: Poor road surfaces, bad weather, and low visibility significantly impact accident severity.
3. High-Risk Locations: Certain areas exhibit a higher accident density, making them critical zones for traffic control measures.
4. Severity Analysis: Factors such as high-speed zones, heavy traffic intersections, and nighttime driving increase accident severity.

Impact & Recommendations:-

1. Enhanced Traffic Safety Measures – Authorities can use these insights to implement stricter road safety regulations.
2. Improved Road Infrastructure – Identifying accident hotspots helps in designing safer roads and better signage.
3. Awareness Campaigns – Targeted awareness programs can educate drivers about high-risk situations.
4. Emergency Response Optimization – Faster response mechanisms can be implemented in accident-prone areas.

By leveraging data-driven insights, this project contributes to reducing accident rates, saving lives, and improving road safety policies.
